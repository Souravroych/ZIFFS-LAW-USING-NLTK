Step 0: Preprocessing - strip the text of punctuation, and lower case the
words - obtaining the original text as a list of words.
Step 1: Now write a function that counts words, unique words, and frequency of occurrence.
Step 2: For the most frequent 25 words and for the most frequent 25 additional ​words that start with the letter ​c (a total of 50 words), print the word, the number of times it occurs, its rank in the overall list of words, the probability of occurrence, and the product of the rank and the probability.
Step 3: Also indicate the total number of words and the total number of unique words that you found.
Step 4: Discuss how this text satisfies Zipf's Law (or why it does not).
